This repository is for the talk "Embedded test-driven development in C with Ruby" I gave at GLSEC 2011. The presentation is available at [this GitHub page](http://fletcherm.github.com/glsec_2011).

The slides are not meant to be standalone; if you weren't at the talk, they may not mean much. Too bad for you.
